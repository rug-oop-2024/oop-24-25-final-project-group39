1-11 21.00:
functional/feature.py - Combined our functional feature file 
model/feature.py - Created model feature class
metric.py - Created get_metric and Metric base class in metric.py

1-11 22:40:
Replaced database.py and storage.py as instructed by announcement
metric.py - Created classes for each metric, created evaluate except for last two
model.py - Made Model an ABC with abstract methods fit and predict as they are used in pipeline.py

3-11 00:40:
artifact.py - Made getters and setters so private attributes work for feature tests
metric.py - Fixed last two metrics

4-11 00:10:
model.py - Created init method and getters for the attributes, was necessary for other class to change params and type

4-11 21:30:
metric.py - Changed metrics precision and recall to MacroAverage of both
test_storage.py - Updated the paths so it works for all operating systems
system.py - Changed forward slashes to backslashes for it to work on Windows
1_Datasets.py - Added dataset management system which can import and delete datasets
2_Modelling.py - Added selecting a dataset and selecting target and import features
storage.py - Changes last forward slashes to backslashes for it to work on Windows
dataset.py - Quick fix in reading datasets
artifact.py - Quick fix in attributes

6-11 13:00:
database.py - Fixed _persist so it can delete dataset when there is more than one saved
metric.py - Added MacroAveragePrecision and MacroAverageRecall
1_Datasets.py - Added reruns and improves saving / loading
2_Modelling.py - Added tons of modelling

7-11 12:15:
pipeline.py - Added to_artifact function to save pipeline
artifact.py - Gave version default value to get rid of error while saving pipeline
1_Datasets.py - Changed everything into functions
2_Modelling.py - Changed everything into functions

9-11 11:45:
metric.py - Fixed classes
model __init__.py - Fixed if-statement and switched classification / regression
2_Modelling.py - Fixed bugs
3_Deployment.py - Fixed bugs

9-11 12:45:
2_Modelling.py - Divided into modelling_handling.py
3_Deployment.py - Divided into deployment_handling.py
modelling_handling.py - Partly from 2_Modelling.py
deployment_handling.py - Partly from 3_Deployment.py
